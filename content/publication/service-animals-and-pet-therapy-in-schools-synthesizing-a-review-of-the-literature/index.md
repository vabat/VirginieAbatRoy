abstract: "As the academic and social-emotional needs of students in schools
  continue to increase, so too does the presence of dogs in educational spaces.
  This article aims to present an overview of past and present animal-assisted
  intervention practices in school settings. This comprehensive literature
  review examines the current state of research within this field of study. Data
  from 29 publications were selected according to strict inclusion and exclusion
  criteria. The results highlight three categories in which the presence of dogs
  in schools have an impact: social-emotional, cognitive, and physiological.
  Challenges to program implementation include health risks, cultural context,
  and negative effects on the animal. Due to the lack of school-based research,
  more study is needed, especially in order to understand the effect of dogs on
  the social-emotional learning of students. Finally, the welfare and training
  of the animals involved should be taken into consideration, and regulations
  regarding handler and animal training should be enforced."
